        \item Let's compare these two methods in terms of two perspectives. \begin{enumerate}[wide=30pt]
            \item Cost perspective.

            Let's consider we use the algorithm as above codes to implement composite quadrature rules. Assume that we consider $n$ (which is even) subintervals. Then composite trapezoidal rule performs $n+1$ additions, $n+1$ multiplications, and $0$ if operations (see 12-20 lines of 1(a)), which implies that it performs totally $2n+2$ operations. However, composite Simpson's rule performs $n+2$ additions, $n+2$ multiplications, and $n-1$ if operations (see 12-25 lines of 1(b)), which implies that it performs totally $3n+2$ operations. Hence, even if we use same number of subintervals, (in here, this value is $n$), composite Simpson's rule takes more cost to compute value. Of course, composite Simpson's rule is more accurate than composite trapezoidal rule because the error term of composite Simpson's rule is $O(h^4)$ which is smaller than the error term of composite trapezoidal rule, $O(h^2)$.
            \item Efficiency perspective.

            If we need less accurate approxmiation, than the composite Trapezoidal rule could be more efficient than the composite Simpson't rule. But in general case, the composite Simpson't rule is more efficient than the composite trapezoidal rule. It is because even if the composite Trapezoidal rule perfomrs better in terms of the number of operations, $O(n)$, the composite Simpson's rule performs much more better in terms of convergence, $O(h^4) \ll O(h^2)$.

        \item Letâ€™s compare these two methods in terms of three perspectives. \begin{enumerate}[wide=30pt]
            \item Accuracy perspective

            Let's consider high order gaussian quadrature with $n$-th order Legendre polynomial. Then this formula is accurate up to polynomial of degree $2n-1$. Then we get $O(h^{2n})$ error term. (Note that this is from naive assumption because the nodes are not equally spaced.) As we increase the order, $h$ decreases and $2n$ increases, which implies the error term is super small. Now consider composite gaussian quadrature with 3rd order Legendre polynomial with $n$ subintervals. Since gaussian quadrature with 3rd order polynomial has $O(h^6)$ naive error term, we get $O(h^5)$ error term. as we increase the number of subintervals, $h$ decreases but the order of error term is maintained. Hence, we can say that the high order gaussian quadrature method is more accurate than the composite gaussian quadrature method.
            \item Cost perspective

            From the above codes, we can think that the number of operations in the method of composite gaussian quadrature is larger than the number of operations in the method of high order gaussian quadrature. But for high order gaussian quadrature, the cost for computing the roots of Legendre polynomial is really big. Hence, the high order gaussian quadrature method is expensive in terms of cost than the composite gaussian quadrature method.
            \item Ease of programming perspective

            To use high order gaussian quadrature method, we should hand-write the roots of the high order Legendre polynomial. It is really annoying process. But if we use composite gaussian quadrature method, we have a small portion of hand-written part, and we can easily consider any number of subintervals (see the line 19-30 3(b)). Hence, programming the composite gaussian method is easier than the high order gaussian method.
        \end{enumerate}
